    <h2>Mivan Technology</h2>
    Mivan Company Ltd. in Malaysia created the Mivan Technology System in the late 1990s as a system for mass
    house construction in poor countries. The units were to be made of cast-in-place concrete with an aluminium
    panel formwork. The technology ensured a quick and cost-effective construction process. The aluminium forms
    provide a concrete surface finish that enables for a high-quality wall surface without the need for significant
    plastering. This is one of the techniques that has been identified as being particularly well suited to Indian
    conditions for large construction, where excellent quality and speed may be attained
